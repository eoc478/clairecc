    <p>Welcome to my Critical Computation Portfolio! My name is Claire and I am a student in Parsons School of Design majoring in Design and Technology. I have just started my coding journey and hope to learn more in my time here at Parsons. I hope the improvement can be seen in my works here. In the future, I would love to work on wearable technology and VR therapy visuals!</p>
